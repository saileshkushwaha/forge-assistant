/**
 * Codec for Forge-managed model routing strings.
 *
 * A single `forge` provider connection is provider-agnostic: unlike the
 * per-provider `*-managed` connections it does not carry the upstream provider
 * on its DB row. The upstream provider therefore has to travel *with* the
 * model. Where a routing site has the provider as a sibling field it uses that
 * directly; where only a single model string is available (telemetry headers
 * like `X-Forge-Resolved-Model`, persisted model overrides, display), the
 * provider is encoded as a `<provider>/<model>` prefix, e.g.
 * `fireworks/accounts/fireworks/models/minimax-m3`.
 *
 * This module is the single source of truth for that encoding. It is a pure
 * codec — no I/O, no wiring — so it can be adopted incrementally.
